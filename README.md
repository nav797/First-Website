<h1>Next Generation Technology Website</h1>

Welcome to the Next Generation Technology project! This is a responsive website page designed using HTML, CSS and a little bit of Javascript. This is my first project and my first complete website. Through this project, I learned how to effectively implement HTML and CSS to create a fully functional site. I gained valuable insights not only into using these languages but also into the thought process necessary for accomplishing various tasks. This project was a great first step into web development.
